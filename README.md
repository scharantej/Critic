 Based on the feedback from the previous runs, I will focus on the following three aspects in this run:

1. Aesthetics: I will ensure that the generated HTML code is aesthetically appealing by incorporating embedded CSS. This will enhance the visual appearance of the website and provide a better user experience.

2. Code Generation: I will ensure that the generated code is free of errors and does not include unnecessary or irrelevant sections. This will make the code more efficient and easier to maintain.

3. Proper Formatting: I will ensure that the HTML files are properly formatted and have the correct connections to the backend database. This will prevent any errors or inconsistencies in the website's functionality.

**Design for a Flask Application - Movie Review Analyzer Website**

**HTML Files**

1. index.html: This will be the main page of the website, providing an overview of the movie review analyzer and its features. It will include a form for users to submit movie reviews and a section displaying the results of the analysis.

2. results.html: This page will display the results of the movie review analysis, including the sentiment score, a summary of the review, and any relevant keywords or phrases.

3. about.html: This page will provide information about the website, its creators, and its purpose. It will also include links to the source code and any relevant documentation.

**Routes**

1. /: This route will render the index.html page.

2. /analyze: This route will accept a movie review as input and return the results of the analysis in JSON format.

3. /about: This route will render the about.html page.

**Additional Features**

In addition to the basic functionality described above, the movie review analyzer website could include additional features such as:

- A user login system to allow users to save their reviews and track their progress over time.
- A database of movie reviews that users can search and browse.
- A forum or comment section where users can discuss movies and share their thoughts.
- A recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their past reviews.
